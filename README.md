# Galaxy
Galaxy -- a Python game for up to 4 players

This is my first large project written in Python!
  

GAME DESCRIPTION:  
It is a game for up to 4 players.
Players can build ships, move around a galaxy, colonize planets, and mine resources, all while trying to prevent other players from doing so.
Watch out, or your opponents might invade your planets and fight off your ships!
--> The first player to colonize 6 planets is the winner.

REQUIREMENTS:  
Galaxy.py was written in Python 2.7.1
The game requires the Python module "termcolor" to run.
It works on a mac terminal.  I suggest making the terminal window fullscreen for best gameplay experience.
